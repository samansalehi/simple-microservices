/*
At TransferWise, we have debit cards all over the world. But, not all debit cards are the same.
For example, they may have a different style, or different spending limits.
For example, this is a set of card types we might offer:

Mastercard Consumer EU:
- Available for customers in EU
- Only for consumer users
- Max 1 card per customer
- Card style: TransferWise Neon Green
- Max monthly limit: 10,000 EUR

Mastercard Business EU:
- Available for customers in EU
- Only for businesses users
- Max 5 card per customer
- Card style: TransferWise Neon Green + Business Blue
- Max monthly limit: 100,000 EUR

Mastercard Consumer USA:
- Available for customers in USA
- Only for consumer users
- Max 1 card per customer
- Card style: TransferWise Neon Green
- Max monthly limit: 15,000 USD

Exercise: We now want to build functionality to check if a customer can order a card. If a customer can order a card,
then we want to know for which type(s). If they can't order a card, then we want to know why not.

Some examples:
- A European consumer should be told that he can order the "Mastercard Consumer EU" card.
- A customer in Brazil should be told that we don't have cards in Brazil yet
- A business customer in US should be told that we don't offer business cards in the US
- A European consumer that already has too many cards should be told that he reached the maximum card limit
